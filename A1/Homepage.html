Basic information: 
I was born in 1998 in Jaghori Afghanistan and moved to Australia in 2005.
I am from the Hazara ethnic group. At the time I was 7 years old when I left
my home country. When I moved to Australia I had absolutely no idea how to
speak or write English so basically, I started from zero. My mother tongue
is Farsi which I speak at home. I completed my primary school and high school
in Australia. Currently I am in my final semester studying Bachelor of Business
Information systems at RMIT. I am the first from my family to get into a 
university which is very accomplishing and rewarding. One fact that people may
be interested to know about me is that sometimes I collect a lot of cups in my room.
This is because I drink a lot of tea and the cups just seem to float everywhere
around my room. Additionally, I enjoy a good Netflix binge but can also be found
on long road trips with friends or on shopping haul. 
<br>
<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
My interest in IT grew when I was doing VCE at High school. I was very amazed with
the ever-changing world of IT and it constantly keeps advancing. I realised that 
every activity we undertake in our lives involves some sort of IT usage and it’s very
important to have IT skills. This is because I believe having IT skills ensures that
that work is done efficiently. Furthermore, I think technology offers a lot of different
tools and software making it easier for us humans to easily solve many problems.
Based on my experience with IT and business subjects at high school, I decided to take
further studies in a field that involves both IT and business. Hence, I thought the 
Bachelor of business information systems was the perfect choice for me. I genuinely
enjoy studying in this course and feel motivated to discover and learn more about IT.
Also, I believe having IT skills are very beneficial for the workplace.  
<h5>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h5>
I choose to attend RMIT because I had some friends who attended this university. So, 
based on their experience and the discussions I had with them they described RMIT as a 
wonderful educational institution to be taking further studies in. So, based on my research
about the university and open events which I attended to, I thought RMIT was the place 
for me. Another reason why I choose to study at RMIT is because it is a reasonably convenient
location. I believed RMIT is the right university for me in helping me succeed, while using
available resources and learning new ideas and skills.    
<br>
<h5>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h5>
•	Improved teamwork skills
<br> 
•	Better time management skills
<br> 
•	Improved communication skills
<br> 
•	Develop on problem solving skills 
<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
My ideal job would include using my exceptional customer service and communication skills. 
I would like to work directly with students, teachers or fellow colleagues in different
departments in some capacity to help solve their IT problems and improve their skills in IT.
In return, this experience will have a positive effect on me as it will ensure I develop my
problem-solving skills at the same time doing my job well. Hence, an IT help desk is a job I desire.

<h5>The result of an online Myers-Briggs test</h5>
<img src="./photos/protag.png" alt="tes1">
<br>
The results of the online Myers-Briggs test have identified my personality type as a “Protagonist” ENFJ-A.
Results showed that I am a person with the extraverted, intuitive, feeling and judging personality traits.
 Also, I am a forthright type of person who loves assisting people, hold strong values. My perspective is
backed by the creative energy (56%) to achieving objectives. Similarly, based on further research about
my personality, I identified that Malala Yousafzai who is the youngest Nobel prize winner and who I
truly inspire also has a protagonist personality type. Protagonists are tolerant, reliable and a natural
leader this means I can confidently take leadership roles. 
<br>
<h5>The results of an online learning style test</h5>
<img src="./photos/test2.png" alt="tes2">
<br>
Based on the learning style test, I have discovered that I am a person who desires to learn in a pragmatist style.
The results show that pragmatists like to try new ideas, experiment, act fast and confidently on ideas while getting
straight to the point instead of having long discussions. There are specific learning methods that for a person
with a pragmatist learning style such as practicals and case studies.      
<br>
<h5>The result of an online IPIP Big Five Factor Markers test</h5>
<img src="./photos/test3.png" alt="tes3">
<br> 
finally, the last test that was chosen to be undertaken was the IPIP Big five personality test. As we can see from
the above table, the highest I scored was in Factor IV. This factor is labelled as Conscientiousness. People such
as me who score high on the IV factor are considered to be careful and diligent. I believe this is a true characteristic of me.

<h5>How to you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h5>
Based on these tests that I have undertaken, now I have a better idea of my styles and abilities while making it easier in taking
the right responsibilities. I have realised not just what my strengths are, but I have also discovered the areas of my weakness.
I know exactly that my personality type is a protagonist and how I best fit in a team.
<br>
<h5>How should you take this into account when forming team?</h5>
Since I have been identified as a protagonist, I can create a team using different people with various personality types.
This way it will help ensure that the team achieves the maximum because I believe great teams are also about personalities
not just about skills. I believe I can be a team leader since I have a protagonist personality style. Also, I will also be
able to confidently say what my ideas are when working in a team. What role to take when working in a team and perform my best
while undertaking tasks in a method I work best in.
