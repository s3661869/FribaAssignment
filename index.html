<h5>Basic information:</h5>
I was born in 1998 in Jaghori Afghanistan and moved to Australia in 2005. I am from the Hazara ethnic group. I was 7 years old when I left my home country. When I moved to Australia I had absolutely no idea how to speak or write English, so basically, I started from zero. My mother tongue is Farsi which I speak at home. I completed my primary school and high school in Australia. Currently, I am in my final semester studying Bachelor of Business Information systems at RMIT. I am the first from my family to get into a university which is very accomplishing and rewarding. One fact that people may be interested to know about me is that sometimes I collect a lot of cups in my room. This is because I drink a lot of tea and the cups just seem to float everywhere around my room. Additionally, I enjoy a good Netflix binge but can also be found on long road trips with friends or on a big shopping haul.  
<br>
<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
My interest in IT grew when I was doing VCE at High school. I was very amazed by the ever-changing world of IT and it constantly keeps advancing. I realised that every activity we undertake in our lives involves some sort of IT usage and it’s very important to have IT skills. This is because I believe having IT skills ensures that that work is done efficiently. Furthermore, I think technology offers a lot of different tools and software making it easier for us humans to easily solve many problems. Based on my experience with IT and business subjects at high school, I decided to take further studies in a field that involves both IT and business. Hence, I thought the Bachelor of business information systems was the perfect choice for me. I genuinely enjoy studying in this course and feel motivated to discover and learn more about IT. Also, I believe having IT skills are very beneficial for the workplace.  
<h5>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h5>
I choose to attend RMIT because I had some friends who attended this university. So, based on their experience and the discussions I had with them they described RMIT as a wonderful educational institution to be taking further studies in. So, based on my research about the university and open events which I attended, I thought RMIT was the place for me. Another reason why I choose to study at RMIT is because it is a reasonably convenient location. I believed RMIT is the right university for me in helping me succeed, while using available resources and learning new ideas and skills.      
<br>
<h5>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h5>
•	Improved teamwork skills
<br> 
•	Better time management skills
<br> 
•	Improved communication skills
<br> 
•	Develop on problem solving skills 
<br>
•	Enhance on my problem-solving skills 
<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
My ideal job would include using my exceptional customer service and communication skills. I would like to work directly with students, teachers or fellow colleagues in different departments in some capacity to help solve their IT problems and improve their skills in IT. In return, this experience will have a positive effect on me as it will ensure I develop my problem-solving skills at the same time doing my job well. Hence, an IT help desk is a job I desire.

<h5>The result of an online Myers-Briggs test</h5>
<img src="./photos/protag.png" alt="tes1">
<br>
The results of the online Myers-Briggs test have identified my personality type as a “Protagonist” ENFJ-A.
Results showed that I am a person with the extraverted, intuitive, feeling and judging personality traits.
 Also, I am a forthright type of person who loves assisting people, hold strong values. My perspective is
backed by the creative energy (56%) to achieving objectives. Similarly, based on further research about
my personality, I identified that Malala Yousafzai who is the youngest Nobel prize winner and who I
truly inspire also has a protagonist personality type. Protagonists are tolerant, reliable and a natural
leader this means I can confidently take leadership roles. 
<br>
<h5>The results of an online learning style test</h5>
<img src="./photos/test2.png" alt="tes2">
<br>
Based on the learning style test, I have discovered that I am a person who desires to learn in a pragmatist style.
The results show that pragmatists like to try new ideas, experiment, act fast and confidently on ideas while getting
straight to the point instead of having long discussions. There are specific learning methods that for a person
with a pragmatist learning style such as practicals and case studies.      
<br>
<h5>The result of an online IPIP Big Five Factor Markers test</h5>
<img src="./photos/test3.png" alt="tes3">
<br> 
finally, the last test that was chosen to be undertaken was the IPIP Big five personality test. As we can see from
the above table, the highest I scored was in Factor IV. This factor is labelled as Conscientiousness. People such
as me who score high on the IV factor are considered to be careful and diligent. I believe this is a true characteristic of me.

<h5>How to you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h5>
Based on these tests that I have undertaken, now I have a better idea of my styles and abilities while making it easier in taking the right responsibilities. I have realised not just what my strengths are, but I have also discovered the areas of my weakness. I know exactly that my personality type is a protagonist and how I best fit in a team. 
<br>
<h5>How should you take this into account when forming team?</h5>
Since I have been identified as a protagonist, I can create a team using different people with various personality types. This way it will help ensure that the team achieves the maximum because I believe great teams are also about personalities not just about skills. I believe I can be a team leader since I have a protagonist personality style. Also, I will be able to confidently say what my ideas are when working in a team. What role to take when working in a team and perform my best while undertaking tasks in a method I work best in. 

<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<h5>Overview</h5>
For my project idea, I have come up with the idea to implement a mobile application for my sister’s new business being a dance school. I have decided to develop a mobile application for her. This app will be android and have various functionalities. Its features will include capabilities such as sending announcements to all stakeholders. Sending messages to specific class groups as well as individuals. Also access to the timetables, and a link to the About Us page that links to the website or Instagram page. The app will have different user roles for students and teachers who have different access to specific things. 
<br>
<h5>Motivation</h5>
This app will be beneficial for the school and its stakeholders such as parents and students. Furthermore, one of the advantages of developing this mobile application is that the app will ensure that school activities run efficiently. This means instead of using a lot of time on one activity, the business can use that time on making improvements on some other required tasks. Although the existing method of communication which is via postal letters are far cheaper and easier than an actual mobile application. However, these letters have been going missing or there has been a huge delay in receiving them. Furthermore, the overload of letters being sent constantly may also bother parents causing them to ignore the letters being sent out. The school has identified that one in three communications are getting lost. This results in a low number of attendances in school events. 
<br>
<h5>Description</h5>
The developed mobile application will consist of specific features such as an announcement platform for parents and students and the wider community. This will be useful for making announcements for events, reminders and other important information. A linked database will be included as part of the feature, this will be used to store user information such as personal login details, messages etc. The associated database that will be used is yet to be discussed with the team. The app will also be capable to send messages to groups and individuals. The app will be further developed to display student timetables. This will be very useful for both teachers and students. The app will also have a feature where students/parents can watch uploaded tutorials and/or performances. This will be categorised either by class or events. When the app is first opened it will have a pop up of the logo/name of the school followed by an about us page. On the “About Us” page, it will also have a link that takes the user to the school Fb page or Instagram page. The “About Us” page will consist of information about the school as well as the teachers. Then the user should be prompted to a page that will have the option of logging in either as a student or as a staff/teacher. This is because the student and teacher accessibility controls will be slightly different as a teacher will have the option to control access to data or make changes or specific updates to announcement’s, timetable and upload of videos. Students can login with their provided id’s and they will have the option of saving their credentials making it easier for the next time they login. Furthermore, the style and colour scheme of the mobile application should match with the schools existing logo and primary colour or existing business card or broachers. The app logo is to be in line with its current colour and style. Overall, the app will be developed in a user-friendly manner ensuring that users feel confident in using it. Once the app is developed, the team will gather a group of users to test and comment on the app. This way it will help the project team to make improvements on defects/bugs if required.
<br>
<h5>Tools and Technologies</h5>
Google Drive will be a good option to use for storing assignment and project documentation so that all team members have access to it. The team is also required to create a WhatsApp or Microsoft Teams’ group to communicate effectively throughout the development of the project. Then the team is required to create a Gantt Chart using an online template or another program. This will help ensure that the team gets tasks delivered on time and the project gets completed on time. Additionally, a markup/wireframe of the project idea is to be created by the team before beginning any coding of the application. If required, the team will also create a pdf file using Microsoft office containing instructions on how to use the mobile application. A popular mobile app database such as MYSQL or Redis will also be used to store data. Further discussion is required about which specific database is to be for data backup. RMIT canvas will be used to refer to information about the project. Based on research, I think the Android studio may be the right software to use for the coding of the app. A physical device such as an android phone may also be required to use as an emulator. This can be useful when testing the app. Laptop computers are to be used when performing all project tasks and communication. Microsoft Outlook is also to be used to communicate between team members and the tutor if we need to clarify anything. Also, an external device may be required to back up just for safety or GitHub can also be used regularly for backup of work just to prevent loss of work. 

<h5>Skills Required</h5>
•	Good communication skills
<br>
•	Time management skills
<br>
•	Risk management skills 
<br>
•	Critical thinking skills 
<br>
•	Tech-savvy 
<br>
•	Designing skills 
It will be feasible to find the required software and hardware required for the implementation of this mobile application. As part of the hardware that will be used for backup of work, I have a USB hardware device that I can lend the team to use for the project. And the rest of the software’s that are required are pretty much what we students use every day such as Microsoft Office applications. Other software’s such as android studio can be easily downloaded at no cost. Likewise, Database software can also be downloaded for free.
<br>
<h5>Outcome</h5>
As the school currently has no access to this type of application, it’s doing everything manually, which means it takes a lot of their time. Anytime leftover from this can be used on improving other areas of the school. Moreover, this app will be very useful for both the school and its stakeholders. Furthermore, communication will not be lost or ignored, and it will also be easier for the school to send out announcements.
